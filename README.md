# termux-starterpack
This script installs essential packages for developers on Termux without requiring root permissions. It installs packages for web development, database management text editors version control and more.

The script first checks if you have root permissions. If not, it proceeds to install packages that don't require root access. It also checks if the visudo file exists, as some packages require editing the file to grant permission for the user to run them without root access. If the visudo file is missing, the script removes the packages that require root access to install.

The script displays a loading spinner while installing each package, which helps keep track of progress. It also informs the user if a package is already installed, and displays a message once all packages have been installed.

This script is useful for developers who want to set up their development environment quickly and easily, without the need for root permissions. The script can be modified to add or remove packages as needed, and can be adapted for use on other Linux distributions.
